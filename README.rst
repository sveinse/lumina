Lumina
======

Home theater automation controller framework

Lumina is a framework for controlling lighting and home theater equiment (such
as AV receivers, projectors). It provides programmable actions when events
occur, such as pressing a wall switch, BD player is being paused. It provides
a simple web server for mobile and PC access of actions and configuration.

The framework is based on Python 2.7 and using Twisted. It has a client-server
scheme, allow multiple units to communicate with a central server. Lumina
can run Raspberry Pi embedded systems.

Initially this framework was written as a one-off installation in my own
private home cinema, and the plugins available reflect my equipment and
my intended use cases.
